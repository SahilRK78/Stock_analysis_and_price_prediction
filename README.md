**Stock Price Prediction App**
This repository contains a Streamlit application for predicting stock prices using historical data. The project utilizes the yfinance library to gather data and implements multiple forecasting models.

**Project Overview**
Data Collection: Historical stock price data was collected using the yfinance library

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted detailed EDA on the collected data over the past 5 years, including visualizations and statistical analysis to identify trends and seasonality.

Model Building:

ARIMA, SARIMAX, and Linear Regression: Implemented these traditional time series models using the 5-year dataset to establish baseline predictions and analyze performance.

LSTM Model: Utilized a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model trained on the 20-year dataset for enhanced performance in capturing complex patterns, building on insights gained from the initial models.

Deployment: The final prediction model is deployed in Streamlit app, allowing users to input parameters and obtain stock price forecasts.
